- Modify the CarRequestPanel and Floor to not engage the call button if there is
  a car docked at that floor going in the right direction.
- Make sure Person does not get on an elevator going the wrong direction.
- Change SingleValueInputPanel to left align the parameter labels on a real-time
  simulation.
- Begin changes to allow progress dialog to display parameters.

2006-04-01 Neil + Chris
- Changed CarController.getNearestBase() to fix a problem where an at-capacity
  elevator might dock and undock repeatedly on the ground floor if there are
  riders waiting to get on.  Riders would push the request button repeatedly,
  which adds the current location to the beginning of the assignments list and
  forces the car to dock.  New code assumes that current location for docked
  cars will be a wrap-around trip allowing the car to leave.
- Changed person to ensure that the monitored car entrance is actually removed
  from payAttentionEntrances when PayAttentionToDoorListener.doorClosed() is
  called.
- Removed the entrance counter from Person.tryToEnterCar() to force agressive
  button pushing.  This prevents people waiting with no pressed button.

2006-02-18 Chris + Neil
- Added setCapacity() to Location to allow the Morning and Evening traffic
  simulators to have enough capacity on the ground floor.

2006-01-21 Neil + Chris
- Moved numerical progress inside the progress bar and adjusted the layout of
  components in the progress dialog.
- Added a cancel button to the progress dialog.
- Changed MultipleSimulationArea to remove the centerPanel and bottomPanel
  before rerunning the simulations.
- Fixed bug in ValueSelector for choosing which Controller from the
  MultipleValueParameter.

2006-01-14 Chris + Neil
- Added a progress dialog and background thread for running multiple
  simulations.
- Fixed a bug in Person dealing with trying to get on a car after it has docked
  but before its doors have opened for the first time (arrived).

2005-12-24 Neil + Chris
- Fixing minor warnings in the source.
- Replaced multidimensional arrays in ResultsGrid with nested ArrayLists.  This
  eliminates an issue with generic types and arrays that makes Neil's head
  explode.
- Modified SingleValueParameter and its children to support generics.

2005-12-17 Chris + Neil
- Convert most code to generics and 1.5 in a new branch.

2005-12-10 Neil + Chris
- Well, that broke the streak.
- Moved ExeptionDialog into org.intranet.ui to make it generally available to
  the UI.
- Updated constructor for ExceptionDialog so the public method takes a Window
  instead of a Frame or Dialog.
- Catch exception in InputPanel when applying parameters.
- Catch exception in MultipleSimulationArea.startSimulation when Simulator is
  initialized.
- Added getCapacity to Location.
- Improved the exception message when a Person moves into a Location that is
  at capacity.
- Prepared the 0.4 release.

2005-11-19 Chris + Neil
- Omigod, two weekends in a row.  You'd think neither of us were working
  overtime.
- Changed ResultsCheck.java to make a test run in seconds instead of hours.
- Implemented the ability to average results over a single multi-value
  parameter.  Files changed included MultipleSimulationArea.java,
  ResultsGrid.java, ResultsSelection.java, ValueSelector.java.  Added
  AverageNumber.java.

2005-11-12 Neil + Chris
- Changed CarEntrance.chooseSomeoneFromList to also check door state when
  determining if the door is available.
- Moved waitToEnterDoor() from leaveCar to waitToEnterDoor in Person to prevent
  a Person from entering the car before the doors have fully opened.  This also
  ensures that people leave the car before others get on.
- Changed Person.tryToEnterCar to check all entrances and to check both that
  the door is obstructed and that people may be waiting before deciding to
  push the button again.  This solves an issue with buttons being pressed when
  a car has already arrived and is exchanging passengers.

2005-09-10 Chris + Neil
- Removed circularity between CarRequestPanel and CarEntrance.
- Added animation of person entering and leaving a car.
- Added waitToEnterDoor to CarEntrance.  This may eventually be the main
  mechanism for specifying the order of who enters and exits the car.

2005-07-16 Neil + Chris
- Implemented sensorObstructed() in CarEntrance and updated Door.open() to work
  correctly when transitioning from CLOSING.
- Added toString() to DoorSensor.State.
- Updated Person to continue waiting if he can't enter the Car immediately.
- Refactored Person to enter any car that is open, unobstructed, and not at
  capacity.
- Percolated knowledge of CarEntrance to CarRequestPanel for arrivedUp and
  arrivedDown methods.

2005-06-04 Neil
- Upgraded TODO in ResultsSelection to SOON.
- Updated HTML in Car, Door, DoorSensor, MovableLocation, and Person to be
  well formed XHTML.

2005-06-04 Chris + Neil
- Add a javadoc target to build.xml
- Add state documentation to Person, Door, MovableLocation, and Car.
- Add state documentation to DoorSensor.
- Move the responsibility for closing doors from the Door to the CarEntrance
  in coordination with the DoorSensor.  Added simple code for People to trigger
  DoorSensors.

2005-05-28 Neil + Chris
- Modified MetaController.findBestCar() to compare the total distance travelled
  by the car (to date) in order to break ties in the cost comparison.  This
  partially solves the problem of cars not being selected if they're at the
  extreme ends of the travel cycle during Morning or Evening simulations.
- Added capacity to Location and, therefore, Floors and Cars.  Floors defaults
  to a large value now.  Car capacity can be set through the Building
  constructor.  Added this parameter to RandomElevatorSimulator.
- Fixed a bug with CarController.arrive() where a direction change would result
  in the wrong direction light coming on.
- Updated ChangeDirectionTest to account for new parameters in
  RandomElevatorSimulator.  Updated ResultsCheck so that
  testRandomElevatorSimulator runs successfully and also faster.  Changed the
  error output in MovableLocation to use System.err instead of System.out.

2005-05-14 Chris + Neil
- Refactor the ClockDisplay formatting.  Create a Duration class for the logic
  to go into.
- Add to the Clock a FeedbackListener that is authoritatively able to dispute
  the incrementing of the time.  See Simulator's Clock.FeedbackListener.
- Changed Event.EventTimeComparator to deal better with large time differences
  by not casting the difference of longs to an int.
- Moved Car.Listener creation from the Controller implementations to the
  Building.  Added arrive() and setNextDestination() to Controller interface
  to retain parts of the old Car.Listener implementations.

2005-05-07 Chris
- Rogue change: format the ClockDisplay as 00:00:00.000.

2005-05-07 Neil + Chris
- Fixed build.xml to include icon.gif in the resulting jar file. (leeson)
- Fixed CarController's docked() implementation to properly switch directions
  at the turn around points and switch the entrance lights correctly. (leeson)
- Minor refactoring of Building.getStatistics().
- Added a Time Factor to the user interface that affects the speed of real-
  time simulations.
- Refactored RealTimeClock to adhere to an ideal real-time interval and treat
  the simulation time in direct proportion to the ideal real-time interval.

2005-04-23 Chris + Neil
- Renamed RequestIndicator to CarRequestPanel to reduce confusion with
  FloorRequestPanel.
- Fixed deadlock issue between the AWT event queue and the simulation event
  processor on updateStatistics() in org.intranet.sim.ui.realtime.Statistics.
- Improved SimpleController.

2005-04-09 Neil + Chris

  results.
- Fixed spinner of controllers as tertiary variable in the results.
- Created a SimpleController that runs the elevators up and down, stopping on
  each floor.

  instead of the String value.

2005-04-02 Chris + Neil
- Added exceptions in FloorRequestPanel for requesting and fulfilling floors.
- Made lots of changes to support being able to select a controller algorithm.

- Removed FloorRequest.  All associated functions moved to FloorRequestPanel.
- Modified FloorContext to use its own copy of the floor list for sorting.

2005-03-05 Chris + Neil
- Fixed a bug where Float parameters for simulations would result in
  a typecast error.  (leeson)
- Fixed a bug in ResultsTable where a single result would be unreadable due
  to a black fore- and background (leeson)
- Added comments to CarController and FloorContext.
- Change default for range parameters to not have a range.
- Fix bugs with specifying fewer than two range parameters. (leeson)
- Make display of the results table when there are fewer than two range
  parameters look better.
- Add icon for the application windows.

2005-01-15 Neil + Chris
