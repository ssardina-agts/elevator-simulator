Future Features for Consideration
=================================

Make a prettier icon.

Give the CarController complete information about the destination of each
request.  This would imply, in the real world, that rather than having up
and down buttons, there would actually be a panel to request a specific
floor.

More complicated building models where only some elevators have access to
some floors.  This would allow the user to configure buildings with banks
of elevators, for example a bank that goes from 1 - 6 and one that goes
from 7 - 12.  Or access restricted floors that only one elevator can go
to.  This would require some refactoring of Person (and other model
elements) so Person knows that whether the elevator will go to the right
place or how to transfer between elevators to reach a destination.

An ability to save simulation configurations.  Ultimately, a simulation editor
would be needed to support very complex simulations.

An ability to save statistics from each run in CSV or some other format
that would allow graphing or analysis.

Real-time updates to the statistics.

Add power consumption to simulation.

Add realistic physics for stopping and starting car movement.

[William wants us to add people to the simulation who try to take the
wrong elevator and smack themselves in the forehead when they get on.
Fat chance.]
